Notebooks and Data for [Jigsaw Rate Severity of Toxic Comments](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-severity-rating).

The Notebooks also use previous Jigsaw Competetions such as:
 -  [Jigsaw Multilingual Toxic Comment Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-multilingual-toxic-comment-classification)
 -  [Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification)
 -  [Toxic Comment Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge)

While the combined data has not been used for competetion, it can be redesigned into a desired format for training purposes.
